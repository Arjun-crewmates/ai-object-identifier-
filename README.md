# AI Object Identifier 🤖📷

This project is an **AI-powered Object Identifier** built with [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) and TensorFlow.js.  
It uses your webcam to recognize objects in real-time and display a prediction with fun emojis for each detected object. 🎉

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time **object recognition** using your webcam.  
- Each object is shown with an **emoji** for a more interactive experience.  
- Powered by [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) and **Teachable Machine**.  
- Simple and visually appealing UI with live camera feed.  

## 🛠️ How It Works
1. The AI model is trained using **Google Teachable Machine**.  
2. The model is deployed in a webpage using TensorFlow.js.  
3. The webcam feed is processed live, and predictions are displayed instantly.  

## 🔗 Model
